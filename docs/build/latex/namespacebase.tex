The base components of Chaos\-Core.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
The base components of Chaos\-Core. Chaos\-Core's base module can be viewed as extensions on the C++ std library, for examples\-: floating point comparison, clamping, utf-\/8 strings. More complex systems that still relate to the C++ std library, such as io are separated into their own modules. The same goes for components that are are more specific, such as the graphics (gfx) module.
