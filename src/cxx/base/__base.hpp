  * ChaosCore's base module can be viewed as extensions on the C++ std library,
  * for examples: floating point comparison, clamping, utf-8 strings.
  * More complex systems that still relate to the C++ std library, such as io
  * are separated into their own modules. The same goes for components that are
  * are more specific, such as the graphics (gfx) module.
